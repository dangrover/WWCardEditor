Flow field: selection behavior:
- Need a way to select none (where active field changes to NSNotFound)
- Active field should be externally changable @done
- Edit mode refinements: @done
	- When going INTO edit mode, set selected field to 0, UNLESS there are no fields, then set it to NSNotFound @done
	- When coming OUT of edit mode, set the selection to none @done
- Fix right-arrow-at-end-of-field bug @done
Key overrides:
- Get tabbing and reverse-tabbing to work
- Enter key should switch to next field (but pastes should still strip returns and newlines)
- Arrow keys should switch between editable fields
- Need to strip formatting from pasted text
Individual flow fields should support:
- Placeholder text @done
- Min length
- Max length
- Format string for validation
Flow field: drawing:
- Placeholder support
- Shadow should only draw if containing window has focus @done
- Should use floor/ceil + 0.5 to avoid drawing on pixel cracks @done
- Need to tweak shadow/edit box to be more like address book
- Optimize to redraw only the passed rect and not the entire view
- Prospective selection should not have a special box around it
- Need to test with multi-line fields

Flow field: general:
- Should be KVO-compliant for the declared keys in the fields
- Edit box shadow should be dynamic
- Should have delegate that it informs about various events occurring (changing fields, etc)
