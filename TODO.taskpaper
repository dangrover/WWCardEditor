General Card Editor Stuff:
- Flow field should know its own height
- Non-active wwflowfields in edit mode should not show any highlighted text, and should not show insertion point
- Need a way to select none (where active field changes to NSNotFound) @done
- The focus rings seem to stop working after enough switching @done
Key handling:
- Arrow keys should switch between editable fields (across entire card editor)
- Enter key should switch to next field (but pastes should still strip returns and newlines)
- Get tabbing and reverse-tabbing to work

Whipped cream and cherries:
- Animated insertion/deletion of rows
- Should be KVO-compliant for the declared keys in the fields
- Key/Value rows should have an option for a menu
- A flow field row should be able to be made from a format string and a dictionary of subfields/tokens
- Individual flow fields should support:
	- Min/max length
	- Format string for validation
- New field types
	- Dictionary.app-style dividers with disclosure triangles
	- Office-style/CSSedit-style dividers with disclosure rects
	- Editable image view
	- +/- buttons for deleting and adding stuff
	- NSPopupMenu with arrows (possibly abstract the checkbox row type into a general nsbutton row type)
