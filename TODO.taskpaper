Flow field: selection behavior:
- Need a way to select none (where active field changes to NSNotFound)
- Fix right-arrow-at-end-of-field bug @done


Key overrides:
- Get tabbing and reverse-tabbing to work
- Enter key should switch to next field (but pastes should still strip returns and newlines)
- Arrow keys should switch between editable fields

Individual flow fields should support:
- Placeholder text
- Min length
- Max length
- Format string for validation

Flow field: drawing:
- Placeholder support
- Shadow should only draw if containing window has focus @done
- Should use floor/ceil + 0.5 to avoid drawing on pixel cracks @done
- Need to tweak shadow/edit box to be more like address book
- Optimize to redraw only the passed rect and not the entire view
- Prospective selection should not have a special box around it
- Need to test with multi-line fields

Flow field: general:
- Active field should be externally changable
- Should be KVO-compliant for the declared keys in the fields
- Edit box shadow should be dynamic
- Should have delegate that it informs about various events occurring (changing fields, etc)
